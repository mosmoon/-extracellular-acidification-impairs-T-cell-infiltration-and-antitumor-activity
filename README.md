# Suppression of the METTL3-m6A-integrin β1 axis by extracellular acidification impairs T-cell infiltration and antitumor activity

# Summary
## The tumor microenvironment (TME) imposes a major obstacle to T-cell infiltration. The acidic metabolic byproducts within the TME hinder T-cell effector functions. Despite this, the specific effects of an acidic environment on the infiltration of T-cells remain largely unexplored. Leveraging the comprehensive TCGA dataset, we pinpointed 16 signature genes that correlate with extracellular acidification. Using the expression profiles of these identified genes, we devised a metric termed the "tumor acidity score" (TuAci) for individual patients. We observed a consistent negative relationship between TuAci and T lymphocyte score (T-score) across diverse human cancer types. Mechanistically, the acidification of the extracellular environment significantly impedes the movement of T-cells by suppressing podosome formation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the downregulation of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) and RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, subsequently impacting the expression of integrin β1 (ITGB1). Notably, enforced ITGB1 expression leads to enhanced T-cell infiltration and improved antitumor activity. Our study suggests that modulating METTL3 activity or boosting ITGB1 expression could be promising strategies to augment T-cell infiltration within the acidic TME and enhance the efficacy of cell therapy.
